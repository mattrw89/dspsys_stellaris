    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the Cortex-M3 core, Memory protection unit, instruction, data &amp; system bus memory interfaces in a cycle accurate manner. Supports systick timer &amp; a flat memory system.No other peripherals are modeled. &#10; This configuration is cycle accurate and hence suitable for algorithms development &amp; benchmarking. &#10; Note on other configurations available for this processor: &#10; * There is a corresponding faster simulator configuration, the functional simulator, that can be used for algorithms development, but doesn't support cycle accuracy. You can change this &quot;Cycle Accurate&quot; configuration to &quot;Functional&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Advanced&quot; button and modifying the &quot;Simulator Type&quot; to &quot;Functional&quot; in the CPU properties. &#10; " id="Cortex-M3 Device Cycle Accurate Simulator, Little Endian">
